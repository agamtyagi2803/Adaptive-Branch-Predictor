# 🧠 ML-Based Branch Predictors

This project implements three different **branch predictors** using machine learning:

- **Perceptron**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Neural Network**

These predictors are designed to predict whether a branch instruction will be taken, based on past execution history.

Trace files were generated by using [cbp2025](https://github.com/anub-dota/cbp2025)

## 📁 Directory Structure

```bash
.
├── example_trace_float.csv       # Trace file with floating-point inputs
├── example_trace_int.csv         # Trace file with integer inputs
├── readme.md                     # This file

```

## 📓 Notebook Overview

All implementations and experiments are in `t2.ipynb`. It includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Implementation of:
  - Perceptron-based predictor
  - Logistic Regression-based predictor
  - Neural Network-based predictor
- Evaluation and comparison of models
- Baseline classical predictors : one-bit and two-bit

## 📊 Trace Files

Two CSV trace files are provided:

- `example_trace_float.csv`
- `example_trace_int.csv`

Each file contains a sequence of branch instruction data including:

- Program counter (PC)
- Global history or features
- Actual outcome (taken/not taken)

## 🧪 Running the Project

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
